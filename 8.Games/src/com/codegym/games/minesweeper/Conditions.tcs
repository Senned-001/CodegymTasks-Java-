Congratulations! The game is done! Run it and see what happens.
If you have time and motivation, you can improve the game by adding some features of your own. For example:
•   limit the number of moves;
•   make it so the first move never hits a mine;
•   make the game easier or harder by changing the number of mines on the field;
•   add visual effects (animation).
You can publish the finished game on CodeGym. But first, you need to check your solution
in order to make the publish button available. The game will be available to all users in the "Games" section.
You can also share it with your friends on social networks. Wouldn't it be great if they played your version of Minesweeper?
After you publish your game, write brief instructions (the possible actions,
the keys/buttons required for the game) and describe the features of your implementation in the comments.


Requirements:
1.	Run the game and play.


Minesweeper (Part 15/16)

As you know, a real minesweeper is mistaken only once. But, fortunately, we can make lots of mistakes in our game.
Let's implement a way to restart the game. To do this, we'll create a restart() method, where we will start
the game, and reset the number of hidden cells, mines, and
points. Don't forget to update the score on the playing field and call the method responsible for creating a game.
In the restart method(), you also need to clear the flags, mines, numbers, etc. from the playing field. We'll restart the game
by clicking the left mouse button.



Minesweeper (Part 14/16)

Admit it — It's not very interesting to play without a score. Let's add this functionality to our game. We will need a variable
to track points. When an unmined cell is revealed, the score increases by 5 points.
To display the score on the playing field, we need to use the Game class's setScore() method,
to which we will pass the total number of points. Note that you need to call this method after increasing the score —
otherwise the wrong result will be shown.
Run the game and try to get the maximum number of points.



Minesweeper (Part 13/16)

The game is won when the number of remaining hidden cells is equal to the number of mines. To count the number
of hidden cells, we'll introduce another variable whose initial value is equal to the total number of cells on the
playing field. The value of this variable will decrease as the cells are revealed. When it becomes equal to the
number of mines, the game is won.
In the event of a win, our game currently does nothing, but it should. It's time to fix that.
Let's write a win() method that stops the game and displays a beautiful congratulatory message to the winner.

Run the game and check that the win() method is run when the player wins.
Note that the win() method is called if the number of hidden cells is equal to the number of mines on the field.
However, if the last revealed cell is a mine, then the method must not be called.



Minesweeper (Part 12/16)

A cell can be revealed only once. If a cell is flagged, it must not be revealed.
And, of course, cells shouldn't be revealed after the game has stopped. Account for all of these points
in the openTile(int, int) method. Now you need to be sure that everything works correctly — start the game and check.



Minesweeper (Part 11/16)

In almost any game, the player either wins or loses. Let's first implement the logic for losing.
To do this, we need a gameOver() method that will stop the game and inform the player about the loss.
To display a message to the player, the engine has a showMessageDialog() method.
To track whether the game has stopped, we introduce a special isGameStopped flag. When
does the player lose? That's right: when a mined cell is revealed. If this
happens, you need to repaint the cell red (Color.RED) and call the gameOver() method.
Don't forget to check whether the game has stopped in the markTile(int, int) method. Run the game and check that everything you've
implemented works.

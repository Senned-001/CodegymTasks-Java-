Write five methods that call each other. Each method should return the name of the method that called it. Use the stack trace to obtain this information.


Requirements:
1.	There should be 5 methods in the class (in addition to the main method).
2.	Each method should call the next: main calls method1, method1 calls method2, etc.
3.	Each method must return the name of the method that called it.
4.	To get the name of the calling method, use the getMethodName method.

The method throws two exceptions that inherit Exception, and two exceptions that inherit RuntimeException:
NullPointerException, ArithmeticException, FileNotFoundException, URISyntaxException.

You need to catch NullPointerException and FileNotFoundException, but not catch
ArithmeticException or URISyntaxException. How do you do that?


Requirements:
1.	The main method must call method1.
2.	The main method must catch the NullPointerException exception.
3.	The main method must catch the FileNotFoundException exception.
4.	The main method must not catch the ArithmeticException exception.
5.	The main method must not catch the URISyntaxException exception.
6.	Don&#39;t change the method1 method.

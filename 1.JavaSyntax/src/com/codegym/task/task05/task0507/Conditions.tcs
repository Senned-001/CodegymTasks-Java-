Use the keyboard to enter numbers, and then calculate the arithmetic mean.
If the user enters -1, display the arithmetic mean of all entered numbers and end the program.
-1 should not be included in the calculation.

Here are some examples:
a) if you enter the numbers
1
2
2
4
5
-1
then we display
2.8

b) if you enter the numbers
4
3
2
1
-1
then we display
2.5

Hint: one of the solutions to this problem uses the following construct:
while (true) {
int number = read the number;
if (check whether the number is -1)
break;
}


Requirements:
1.	The program must read data from the keyboard.
2.	The program should display data on the screen.
3.	After entering -1, the program must correctly terminate.
4.	If you sequentially enter the numbers 1, 2, 2, 4, 5 and -1, the program should display 2.8.
5.	If you sequentially enter the numbers -100, 0, 100, and -1, the program should display 0.0.
6.	If you sequentially enter the numbers 1 and -1, the program should display 1.0.
7.	The displayed result should match the task conditions for any input data.

Create the Cat class with five constructors:
- Name,
- Name, weight, age
- Name, age (standard weight)
- Weight, color (name, address, and age are unknown; the cat is homeless)
- Weight, color, address (someone else's pet)
The constructor's job is to make the object valid.
For example, if the weight is unknown, then you need to specify some average weight. A cat can't weigh nothing.
The same applies to age. But there may or may not be a name (i.e. name might be null). The same applies to the address (it might be null).


Requirements:
1.	The Cat class must have a String variable name.
2.	The Cat class must have an int variable age.
3.	The Cat class must have an int variable weight.
4.	The Cat class must have a String variable address.
5.	The Cat class must have a String variable color.
6.	The class must have a constructor that takes a name as an argument, but initializes all variables except the address.
7.	The class must have a constructor that takes a name, weight, and age as arguments, and initializes all variables except the address.
8.	The class must have a constructor that takes a name and age as arguments, and initializes all variables except the address.
9.	The class must have a constructor that takes a weight and color as arguments, and initializes all variables except the name and address.
10.	The class must have a constructor that takes a weight, color, and address as arguments, and initializes all variables except the name.

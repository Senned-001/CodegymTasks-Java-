Create a Cat class with five initializers:
- Name,
- Name, weight, age
- Name, age (standard weight)
- Weight, color (unknown name, address and age, i.e. a homeless cat)
- Weight, color, address (someone else's pet)

The initializer's job is to make the object valid.
For example, if the weight is unknown, then you need to specify some average weight. A cat can't weigh nothing.
The same applies to age and color. But there may or may not be a name (i.e. name might be null). The same applies to the address (it might be null).


Requirements:
1.	The program must not read data from the keyboard.
2.	The Cat class must have a String variable name.
3.	The Cat class must have an int variable age.
4.	The Cat class must have an int variable weight.
5.	The Cat class must have a String variable address.
6.	The Cat class must have a String variable color.
7.	The class must have an initialize method that takes a name as an argument, but initializes all variables except the address.
8.	The class must have an initialize method that takes a name, weight, and age as arguments, but initializes all variables except the address.
9.	The class must have an initialize method that takes a name and age as arguments, and initializes all variables except the address.
10.	The class must have an initialize method that takes a weight and color as arguments, and initializes all variables except the name and address.
11.	The class must have an initialize method that takes a weight, color, and address as arguments, but initializes all variables except the name.

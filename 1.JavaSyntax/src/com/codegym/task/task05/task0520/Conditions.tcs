Create a Rectangle class. The data for this class will be top, left, width, and height.
Create as many constructors as possible.
Here are some examples:
-	4 parameters are specified: left, top, width, height
-	width/height is not specified (both are 0)
-	height is not specified (it is equal to the width), we'll create a square
-	create a copy of another rectangle passed in as an argument

1.	The Rectangle class must have int variables top, left, width and height.
2.	The class must have at least one constructor.
3.	The class must have at least two constructors.
4.	The class must have at least three constructors.

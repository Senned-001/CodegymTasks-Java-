Figure out what the program does.
Correct the constructor with two parameters so that it calls another constructor with a radius of 10. Think about which constructor you need to call.
Hint: carefully study the implementation of the default constructor.


Requirements:
1.	The class must have 3 constructors.
2.	The constructor with two parameters must initialize the variables x and y to the passed values.
3.	The constructor with two parameters must initialize the variable radius to a value of 10.
4.	The constructor with two parameters must call another constructor, passing the correct arguments.
5.	Don&#39;t change the main method.
6.	Don&#39;t change the default constructor.

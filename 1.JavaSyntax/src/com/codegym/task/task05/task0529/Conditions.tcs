Use the keyboard to enter numbers and calculate their sum until the user enters the word "sum". Display the resulting sum on the screen.
Hint: to read from the keyboard until the string 'exit' is input, do this:
BufferedReader buffer = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
while (true)
{
String s = buffer.readLine();
if (s.equals("exit"))
break;
}


Requirements:
1.	The program must read data from the keyboard.
2.	The program should stop reading data from the keyboard after the user enters the word &quot;sum&quot; in lowercase letters and presses Enter.
3.	The program should work correctly if the user enters one number and the word &quot;sum&quot;.
4.	The program should work correctly if the user enters two numbers and the word &quot;sum&quot;.
5.	The program should work correctly if the user enters more than two numbers and the word &quot;sum&quot;.
6.	The program should display text on the screen.

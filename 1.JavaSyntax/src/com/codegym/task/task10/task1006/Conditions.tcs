Remove unnecessary operators to get the correct answer: result: 1000.0
double d = (short) 2.50256e2d;
char c = (short) 'd';
short s = (short) 2.22;
int i = (short) 150000;
float f = (short) 0.50f;
double result = f + (i / c) - (d * s) - 500e-3;


Requirements:
1.	The program should display text on the screen.
2.	Don&#39;t change the screen output command.
3.	The main() method must contain a char variable c.
4.	The main() method must contain a short variable s.
5.	The main() method must contain an int variable i.
6.	The main() method must contain a float variable f.
7.	The main() method must contain a double variable d.
8.	The main() method must contain a double variable result.
9.	Don&#39;t change the initial value of the variables during initialization. You can only change the cast operators.
10.	The program should display &quot;result: 1000.0&quot;.

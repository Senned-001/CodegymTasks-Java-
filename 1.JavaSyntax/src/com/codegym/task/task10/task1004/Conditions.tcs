Add one type conversion to get the following answer: nine = 9
short number = 9;
char zero = '0';
int nine = (zero + number);


Requirements:
1.	The program should display text on the screen.
2.	Don&#39;t change the screen output command. You can only add cast operators to it.
3.	The main() method must contain a short variable number.
4.	The main() method must contain a char variable zero.
5.	The main() method must contain an int variable nine.
6.	Don&#39;t change the initial value of the variables during initialization. You can only add cast operators.

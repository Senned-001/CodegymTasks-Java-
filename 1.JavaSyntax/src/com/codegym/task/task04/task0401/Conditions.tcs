Think about what the program is doing.
Fix the programming error so that person.age changes value.
Hint: carefully review the adjustAge method.


Requirements:
1.	The program should display text on the screen.
2.	The Person class should have a public int field called age.
3.	The Person class&#39;s adjustAge method should display text on the screen.
4.	The Person class&#39;s adjustAge method must have only one int parameter named age, and the method must be void.
5.	The main method should call the adjustAge method only once.
6.	The Person class&#39;s adjustAge method should increase the Person&#39;s age by 20.

for the first quadrant: a>0 and b>0;
for the second quadrant: a<0 and b>0;
for the third quadrant: a<0 and b<0;
for the fourth quadrant: a>0 and b<0.
Example for 4 6:

Example for -6 -6:
3


Requirements:
1.	The program should read the numbers from the keyboard.
2.	The program should use System.out.println() or System.out.print().
3.	If the point is in the first quadrant, display &quot;1&quot;.
4.	If the point is in the second quadrant, display &quot;2&quot;.

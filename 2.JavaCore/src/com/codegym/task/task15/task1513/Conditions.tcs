Simplify the code:
- remove everything that will be generated automatically by the compiler
- remove all class inheritance that will be added automatically by the compiler
- remove all constructors that will be automatically created and added.


Requirements:
1.	The Car class should not have explicit no-argument constructors.
2.	The Machine class should not have explicit no-argument constructors.
3.	The Car class must be a descendant of the Machine class.
4.	The code should not have explicit inheritance involving the Object class (extends Object).
5.	The Car class should not explicitly inherit the Runnable interface.

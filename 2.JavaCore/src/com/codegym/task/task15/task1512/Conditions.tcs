Take a look at what constructor-related stuff may be added during compilation, but is already present in this program.
Simplify the code. Remove all constructors and calls of superclasses' constructors that are created and added automatically.

PS: The NakedCat, NormalCat, and SiamCat classes have an is-a (inheritance) relationship: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is-a


Requirements:
1.	The NormalCat class must be a descendant of the NakedCat class.
2.	The SiamCat class must be a descendant of the NormalCat class.
3.	Simplify the code in the NakedCat class.
4.	Simplify the code in the NormalCat class.

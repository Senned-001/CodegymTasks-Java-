1. Figure out what the program does.
2. Arrange the calls to join() so that each cat does the following:
2.1. First, the cat gives birth to kittens.
2.2. Then all the kittens climb out of the basket in random order.
2.3. Finally, the cat brings them back into the basket.
2.4. These events for one cat may be interspersed with events for another cat.
2.5. Add kitten nap-time (sleep 200 ms) to investigateWorld.


Requirements:
1.	The join method should be called on each kitten (Kitten object).
2.	The investigateWorld method should let the kitten sleep for 200 ms. Use Thread.sleep(200).
3.	The program should create two cats and four kittens.
4.	Don&#39;t change the methods that are responsible for screen output.
5.	The program&#39;s output must indicate that the task conditions have been satisfied.

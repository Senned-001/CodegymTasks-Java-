Figure out what the program does.
Implement the calculateHorsesFinished method. It must:
1. Calculate and return the number of horses that have finished. Use the isFinished() method.
2. If a horse has not yet crossed the finish line (!IsFinished()), then:
2.1. Display "Waiting for " + horse.getName().
2.2. Wait until it finishes the race. Think about what method you need to use to do this.
2.3. Not treat such a horse as finished.


Requirements:
1.	The calculateHorsesFinished method must return the number of horses that have finished.
2.	The calculateHorsesFinished method must call the isFinished method on each horse in the passed list.
3.	If any of the horses in the passed list has not yet finished, then the calculateHorsesFinished method should display &quot;Waiting for &quot; + horse.getName(). Example output for the first horse: &quot;Waiting for Horse_01&quot;.
4.	If any of the horses in the passed list has not yet finished, then the calculateHorsesFinished method must wait until it finishes. Use the correct method for waiting.
5.	After the program is finished, the console must indicate that all the horses have finished. Example output for the first horse: &quot;Horse_01 has finished the race!&quot;.

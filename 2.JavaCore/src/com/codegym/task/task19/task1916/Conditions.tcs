Read 2 file names from the console: file1 and file2.
Both files contain text, but file2 is an updated version of file1. Some of the lines are still the same.
You need to create a merged version of the lines by writing them to the lines list.
The ADDED and REMOVED labels can't be used consecutivelyâ€”they must always separated by the SAME label.
The example includes empty lines for clarity.
Neither the original file nor the updated file have empty lines!
Example 1:
original        updated             merged
file1:          file2:              Result: (lines)

line1           line1               SAME line1
line2                               REMOVED line2
line3           line3               SAME line3
line4                               REMOVED line4
line5           line5               SAME line5
line0               ADDED line0
line1           line1               SAME line1
line2                               REMOVED line2
line3           line3               SAME line3
line4               ADDED line4
line5           line5               SAME line5
line0                               REMOVED line0

Example 2:
original        updated             merged
file1:          file2:              Result: (lines)

line1           line1               SAME line1
line0               ADDED line0

In the example, empty lines mean that the line is not in the specified file.


Requirements:
1.	The Solution class must contain a LineItem class.
2.	The Solution class must have an enum called Type.
3.	The Solution class must have a public static List&lt;LineItem&gt; field called lines that is initialized immediately.
4.	In the main(String[] args) method, the program must read file names from the console (use BufferedReader).
5.	In the main(String[] args) method, the BufferedReader used for reading input from the console must be closed after use.
6.	The program must read the contents of the first and second file (use FileReader).
7.	The file input streams (FileReader) must be closed.
8.	The lines list should contain the merged version of the lines from the files. Each line should start with the label ADDED, REMOVED, or SAME, depending on the action taken.

After deserializing a Solution object, map m was discovered to have no data :(
Fix 1 bug.


Requirements:
1.	The Solution class should not have a void Solution method without parameters.
2.	The Solution class should have a no-argument constructor.
3.	The Solution class should have a size method without parameters.
4.	The Solution class&#39;s size method must return an int.

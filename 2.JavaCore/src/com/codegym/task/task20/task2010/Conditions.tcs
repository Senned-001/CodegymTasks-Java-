Make it so that the Object class can be serialized.


Requirements:
1.	The Object class must be inside the Solution class.
2.	The Solution.Object class must be static.
3.	The Solution.Object class be public.
4.	The Solution.Object class should support the Serializable interface.
5.	The Solution.String class should support the Serializable interface.

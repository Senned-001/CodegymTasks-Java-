REQUIRED CONNECTED LIBRARIES: Jackson Core, Bind and Annotation 2.6.1

Two classes have the same fields, but they don't have a common superclass. Example, First and Second classes.
Implement the convertOneToAnother method, which should return an instance of the resultClassObject class,
whose fields are equal to the fields in the one object.
Use an ObjectMapper object.
Everybody knows that classes have a JSON annotation where the property equals the class's name in lowercase letters.
For example, for the First class, its className="first"
The First and Second classes themselves are not tested â€” they are provided as test data.


Requirements:
1.	The convertOneToAnother method should return an instance of the resultClassObject class, whose fields are equal to the fields of the one object.
2.	An ObjectMapper object must be created in the convertOneToAnother method.
3.	The convertOneToAnother method must be static.
4.	The convertOneToAnother method must be public.

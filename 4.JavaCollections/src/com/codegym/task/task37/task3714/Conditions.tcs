Hi, Amigo! I recently developed an interest in your planet's history and became interested in the Ancient Roman period.
It would have been interesting to live then! Nonstop entertainment and wine! Or slavery if your starting location wasn't lucky...

Basically, I need a romanToInteger method that will convert a
Roman numeral {I, V, X, L, C, D, M} into a base ten number. Otherwise, it's impossible to know what
happened when with them.


Requirements:
1.	The romanToInteger method must convert a Roman numeral number into a base ten number.
2.	The romanToInteger method must return an int value and accept one String argument.
3.	The romanToInteger method must be public.
4.	The romanToInteger method must be static.

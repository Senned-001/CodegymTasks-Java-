Amigo, we have a problem! During a visit to Planet #IND893, we dared to outsource the automatic assignment of
incoming tasks for crew members. It's hard to believe, but now it seems that the first mate has to
do everything!

We need to fix the program quickly, because cabin boys can scrub the deck, but only the captain can
shout "Battle stations!"

P.S. Try to implement the handleRequest method so that we don't have to change it
if we add new positions. Don't touch the other methods.
P.P.S. All enums support the Comparable interface.


Requirements:
1.	The request must be handled by the current crew member, if possible.
2.	The request must be passed up the chain if the current crew member can&#39;t handle it.
3.	The CabinBoy, Engineer, FirstMate, and Captain classes must inherit AbstractCrewMember.
4.	The AbstractCrewMember class must be abstract.

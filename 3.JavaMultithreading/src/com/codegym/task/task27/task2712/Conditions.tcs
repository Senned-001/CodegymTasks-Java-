Now we can create orders. Let's make it so they are automatically sent to the cook.
There are many different ways to implement this functionality.
Read about the Observer pattern at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern
It's already implemented in Java, and we're going to use it.

1. Create a Cook class in the kitchen package. It's going to handle the cooking. The constructor will take the cook's name, which will be output by the toString method.

2. Tablet creates orders, and Cook prepares them. Properly assign Observer and Observable to Tablet and Cook.

3. The void update(Observable observable, Object arg) method, which must be implemented, has two parameters.
- observable is the object that sent us the value
- arg is the value itselfâ€”in our case, an Order object
At this stage, we'll only simulate preparing the orders by displaying "Start cooking - " + order

3. Let's write the main method.
For the Observable object, add our own Observer object. See item 2 and the description of the pattern in Wikipedia
We give the cook a name. The name doesn't affect the tests. In my version, the cook's name is Amigo. :)

Let's check the console output. Example of my output:
Your order: [Soup] from Tablet{number=5}
Start cooking - Your order: [Soup] from Tablet{number=5}

4. Don't forget to do the following immediately after creating the order and displaying it on the console (find this place in the code):
4.1. Set the flag using setChanged()
4.2. Send the order to the observer using notifyObservers(order);

5. We'll also make a small change. Make it so that the createOrder method returns the current order, or null if the order couldn't be created.


Requirements:
1.	The Cook class constructor must take a string as an argument and initialize the cook&#39;s name (name field).
2.	The Cook class&#39;s toString method must return the name field.
3.	The Cook class must implement the Observer interface.
4.	The Tablet class must be a descendant of the Observable class.
5.	The Tablet class&#39;s createOrder method must call the setChanged method.
6.	The Tablet class&#39;s createOrder method must call the notifyObservers method with the current order as the argument.
7.	The Cook class&#39;s update method should display a string formatted according to the task conditions.
8.	The Restaurant class&#39;s main method should create a new cook and use the addObserver method to add it the tablet as an observer.


Restaurant (part 2)


1. We work with the console a lot. It's time to create a single point of interaction.
Create a ConsoleHelper class with a single BufferedReader, through which we will work with the console.
Remember, this class does not store any data or state, so all its methods will be static.
Create three methods in it:
- writeMessage(String message) - for displaying message on the console
- String readString() - for reading strings from the console
- List<Dish> getAllDishesForOrder() - asks the customer to select a dish and adds it to the list.
Display a list of all the dishes and ask the customer to enter a string (the name of a dish).
The customer enters 'exit' to indicate the order is complete.
If the entered dish is not on the menu, display a message stating that there is no such dish and continue taking the order.
Rethrow IO exceptions. It isn't clear what to do with them at this level.

2. Refactor the code so that we work with the console only through the ConsoleHelper class.

3. Let's return to the Order class: it has a reference to the tablet, as well as a list of chosen dishes.
Initialize the dishes list in the constructor by calling the getAllDishesForOrder method from the ConsoleHelper.

4. Rewrite the toString method in the Order class. Let it return an empty string if there are no dishes in the order. Otherwise,
the output should be similar to the example, in the order in which the dishes were added. Use ConsoleHelper.
Also, change the Tablet class's toString method (inside the Tablet class, press Alt+Insert -> toString()).
Example:
Your order: [Juice, Fish] from Tablet{number=5}

5. We have everything tied to the console. But, if there are exceptions, our application will die.
To learn the cause, we'll add to the Tablet class a static java.util.logging.Logger logger field, initialized with the class name (Logger.getLogger(Tablet.class.getName())).

6. We handle IO exceptions in the Tablet class's createOrder method.
Let's write "The console is unavailable." The log level is SEVERE, which is the most serious level (the application cannot continue).
Also, a new order must be created in the Tablet class's createOrder method.

7. We need to start testing our application.
In the main method, create a tablet and create four orders.



Restaurant (part 1)


Let's write a program to automate what happens in a restaurant.

We'll state the task like this: the restaurant manager wants the following:
1) each table has a tablet that can be used to place orders;
2) while an order is being prepared, the tablet shows ads;
3) at the end of the business day, various statistics can be reviewed:
a) cook utilization;
b) total revenue from orders;
c) total revenue from ad impressions.

We'll develop the kernel (without a GUI). You can add a GUI later yourself. For now, we'll limit ourselves to a console interface.
We'll also hardcode some of the data. Later, you can connect a DB to work with.

Let's point out several features that we're going to implement:

First:
- Customer orders will be sent to the cook automatically;
- The cook will prepare an order for a while and then mark it as prepared;
- Then the waiter will carry it away.

Second:
- Select the desired commercials from a list of paid ads;
- Display commercials while the order is being prepared;
- Maximize the ad revenue.

Third:
- Calculate the statistics;
- Display the statistics to the manager.

We'll start with the first feature: automated order processing:

Let's begin...
1. Create a Restaurant class with the main method.

2. Let's start with the tablet: create a Tablet class, where we'll create a final int number field. This is the tablet number,
which will let us unambiguously determine where each order came from. The tablet number must be initialized in the constructor using a passed argument.

3. In the Tablet class, create a public void createOrder() method that creates an order consisting of the dishes chosen by the customer.
To do this, create an Order class, which we will place in the kitchen package.

4. The Order class should have information about the list of dishes chosen by the customer.
In other words, somewhere there should be a list of all dishes, and the Order class should have  a list of chosen dishes.
The Order class needs private final Tablet tablet and protected List<Dish> dishes fields.
The constructor must have one Tablet parameter and initialize the tablet field.

5. We need a Dish class. Create it in the kitchen package. Let it be an enum with the following list of dishes: Fish, Steak, Soup, Juice, Water.

6. To allow the customer to choose which dishes he or she wants, you need to display them all. To do this, in the Dish class, create a
public static String allDishesToString() method that creates a string containing all the dishes.
For example, "Fish, Steak, Soup, Juice, Water". Generate the string dynamically.

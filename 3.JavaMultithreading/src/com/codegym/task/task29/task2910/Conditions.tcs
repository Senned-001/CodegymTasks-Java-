Amigo, can you believe it? In the 21st century, there was a sport called biathlon. It involved people skiing and shooting targets at
special ranges. They had to hit 5 targets in one round of shooting. Participants shot
while standing and in a prone position, but we won't go into the details. The best humans
achieved an average shooting accuracy of 90%, with strong unremarkable competitors hitting 81.5%.
I wrote a program that creates a competition and adds 30 biathletes to it. Each of
them is assigned random accuracy (in the range of 0.815 to 0.900). The penalty for each miss is
an additional 20 seconds added to the result. The competition also has several shooting lanes (4) and a distance that
the biathletes must cover (20 km).
I also created a control athlete whose performance metrics are hardcoded:
Speed: 20 km/h;
Chance of a hit: 0.900 (90%);
Number of misses: 2 (Participants are to get 20 hits. With an accuracy of 90 percent, 2 misses are expected);
The control athlete needs to cover 20 km at a speed of 20 km/h. The required time is 1 hour, i.e. 3600 seconds.
Race time (including penalty seconds): 3600 + 2 * 20 = 3640 seconds.
I want to determine how fast each athlete needs to go given a random number of misses
so that the result in seconds is the same as the control athlete. I'll first display the result
of the control athlete, and then all the results. Finally, I'll display all the athletes who have the same time
as the control athlete. Due to rounding, some athletes' total time will differ by a fraction
of a second. We don't need them. For the others, their race time is exactly 3640 seconds, like the control athlete, but
they are not displayed in the "ATHLETES WITH THE SAME TOTAL TIME AS THE CONTROL ATHLETE:" section.

Here's your task: make one code change (add, delete, or change one character) to fix a bug.
Note: All the rounding is correctâ€”don't add any new rounding!


Requirements:
1.	Don&#39;t change the data types of the constants.
2.	The &quot;ATHLETES WITH THE SAME TOTAL TIME AS THE CONTROL ATHLETE:&quot; section must include all the athletes who have the same time as the control athlete.
3.	Make one change to the Competition class.
4.	Don&#39;t change the Constants class.
5.	Don&#39;t change the Solution class.
6.	Don&#39;t change the Athlete class.

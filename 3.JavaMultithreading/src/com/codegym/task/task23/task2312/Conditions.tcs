Now the logic for controlling the mouse.
Two things happen with the mouse.
First, the snake eats the mouse.
Second, a new mouse appears at a random place in the room.

You must write and implement the createMouse() method in the Room class.
This method should just create a new mouse with random coordinates in the room.
How do you get random coordinates?
You should already know. But just in case, I'll give you a clue:
int x = (int) (Math.random() * width);

We also need an eatMouse() method in the event that someone ends up eating the mouse. :)
For now, this method won't have complex logic. We'll just call the createMouse method.


Requirements:
1.	The createMouse method must be created in the Room class.
2.	In the createMouse method, a new mouse must be created according to the task conditions and stored in the mouse field.
3.	The eatMouse method must be created in the Room class.
4.	The eatMouse method should include a call to the createMouse method.


Snake (part 10)


Let's tackle the main method.

First, you need to create a static Room game field in the Room class. The variable should be accessible from all classes.

Now in the main method:
a) Create the snake, a Snake object.
b) Create the room, a Room object, and pass the width, height, and snake to it.
c) Set the snake direction equal to SnakeDirection.DOWN

What else is missing? Namely, the method that will contain all the game logic.
And we also need a method that will draw all this on the screen:
a) create a void run() method
b) create a void print() method



Snake (part 9)


The most important class remains: Room.
What do we need to describe it?
One, the dimensions of the room (width and height).
Two, a Snake
Three, a Mouse.

Here's what we need:
a) create int width and height variables in the Room class.
b) create a Snake snake variables in the Room class.
c) create a Snake mouse variable in the Room class. Just kidding. I mean a Mouse, of course :).
d) create getters and setters for all of them.
e) create a constructor. The constructor must have three parameters: width, height, and... snake!



Snake (part 8)


It's the Snake class constructor's turn.

Initially, the snake consists of one piece: the head.
And what does it require?
What needs to be passed to the constructor?
The coordinates of the snake, of course.

Here's what we need:
a) Pass the coordinates of the snake's head (x and y) to the constructor.
b) create the first "piece of the snake" (the head) in the constructor and add it to the sections collection (ArrayList).
c) set isAlive to true.
d) don't forget to initialize the sections variable in the constructor. You can't add much to a null object!
e) create and implement the int getX() method. The method should return the x-coordinate of the snake's head.
e) create and implement the int getY() method. The method should return the y-coordinate of the snake's head.
g) also add a move() method to the classâ€”it will come in handy later.
h) the constructor must be public.



Snake (part 7)


We've described the "pieces of the snake". Now we'll deal with the snake itself.

The snake must have a list of SnakeSections and a head.
Let the head just be the very first piece (index 0).

The snake also has a direction in which it moves by default.
And there is also a condition: whether the snake is alive or dead.
The game ends when the snake is dead.

Here's what we need:
a) Add a List<SnakeSection> sections field to the Snake class.
b) Add a boolean isAlive field.
c) Add a SnakeDirection direction field.
d) Add getters for all the fields, and a setter for direction.

Note:
For boolean fields, the getter is usually named isValue(), not getValue(), to improve the readability of the code.
But don't call it isIsAlive(). One "is" will be enough.
Note 2:
All fields created in this task should be private, while all of the methods should be public.



Snake (part 6)


Now let's tackle the SnakeSection class.
It will describe one piece of the snake.

And what does each piece have?
Right! Coordinates.

Add two fields to the SnakeSection class: int x and int y.
Add getters for these fields and a constructor with two int parameters.
